            <em>The data has not yet been verified to be correct!</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            While some of the results of the findings here are very interesting, they have not yet been properly verified. They could be wrong, they could be right. If you can help everyone out by verifying that the data from Parltrack, and the scripting in the open source projects, is correct - please do! There is currently (2014-01-28) work in progress to require machine-readable sources of data straight from the European Parliament, but until that has been resolved, keep in mind that this data is based upon parsing PDF-files meant for human eyes and paper printer consumption.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data has not been filtered to reflect any opinions on votings, voters or votes. The data has only been reduced to include only votings with recorded corrections.
        </p>

            What is a corrected vote?
        </h2>

        <p>
            During votings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a> (EP), each elected and present <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</a> (MEP) record their votes. Choices are For, Abstain and Against. If they discover that they made the wrong choice, they themselves can record their vote as being incorrect. This doesn't change the outcome of the voting, it is only done after the votes have been counted.
        </p>

        <p>
            My inital thought regarding these corrected votes, is that they are purely erroneous button clicks in the electronic voting process. The number of corrected votes during certain votings, the number of corrected votes some individual MEPs have recorded and the obvious group belongings of the correctors, seem to tell a different story though. I now leave it up to you to dig deeper. I will be here to assist, if there are questions or suggestions.

            Votings in the European Parliament that have corrections. Since the statistics are run over the complete data set, it doesn't take the five year parliament terms into consideration (yet).

                Duplicated votings found in Parltrack's upstream data
            </h3>
            <p>
                This evening, at least 2136 duplicate votings were found. They seem to stem from the fact that he has been sent duplicate lists, but under different voting titles or languages. This is yet another reason why being delivered original data directly from the European Parliament is important!
            </p>
            <p>
                Update: a new, deduplicated dataset has been released from Parltrack. The dumps on this page, from 2014-01-29T23:44:56Z, should be based on it.

                JSON with normalized and worst offenders list found to have incorrect MEP names
            </h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to a journalist, errors propagated to the data with normalized names, which is the source for the lists of "worst offenders", have been discovered!
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the data source in Parltrack is PDF files, which is far from optimal, there are sometimes problems with parsing them into a usable database. Having incorrect names affects the total count, since the totals have been grouped by name. This is the most recently released <a href="output/2014-01-28T231051Z/worst-offenders.txt">list of MEPs (grouped by name) who have made corrections, ordered by number of corrections in ascending order</a> -
                <em>it contains the incorrect grouping</em>. The other lists have been unlinked, at least for now, and I'll work on a solution.

                Until the data has been verified by others, I would take it with a grain of salt. If you are apt at verifying data like this, please help out!

            The corrected vote data broken out in <a href="https://github.com/joelpurra/ep-erroneous-votes">ep-erroneous-votes</a> is being used to present a long list of votes. Not sure this would be called visalization, but with the help of investigative journalists, I'm sure something will come up!

            It would be interesting to look at corrected votes in the European Parliament. How many are there, is there a pattern and such. Here's the start of a narrowed down dataset, with only voting that have corrections and only those who corrected their votes.
